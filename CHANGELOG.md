## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Renamed the `wallet` CLI command group to `smart-account` (with `sa` as a
  shorter alias), and flattened the former nested `sa` admin subgroup so its
  verbs (`deploy-webauthn-verifier`, `migrate-verifier`, `list-verifiers`,
  `list-rules`, `register-multicall`, `unregister-multicall`, `timelock`) are now
  direct children of `smart-account` alongside `rules`, `signers`, and
  `multicall`. This is a breaking change to the CLI command surface.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-07-03

First public alpha of the Stellar Agent Wallet: a Stellar wallet for AI agents.
It provides a `stellar-agent` CLI and a `stellar-agent-mcp` MCP server over a shared
policy engine, operator-approval spine, and tamper-evident audit log.

### Added

- `stellar-agent` CLI for accounts, payments, balances, trustlines,
  claimable-balance claims, Friendbot funding, fee stats, counterparty identity,
  smart-account governance, DeFi, the channel-account pool, profiles,
  credentials, approvals, audit verification, and agent toolsets.
- `stellar-agent-mcp` MCP stdio server exposing the wallet capabilities as tools
  to an MCP client. It starts on hosts without an OS keyring backend (for example
  headless servers), serving read-only and simulate tools; signing tools are
  refused with a keyring error until a backend is configured.
- Policy engine with a no-op gate and a typed first-match, default-deny V1 engine
  evaluating each action to allow, deny, or require operator approval.
- Operator-approval spine: a per-profile pending-approval store and an
  HMAC attestation binding each approval to the executed envelope and the
  approving OS user.
- Hash-chained, append-only JSONL audit log that records key names only (never
  argument values), with `audit verify` chain and HMAC-sidecar verification.
- Key custody via the platform keyring with a TTL-bounded, zeroize-on-drop,
  memory-locked unlock window; profiles name keyring entries and hold no secrets.
- OpenZeppelin smart-account governance: context rules, ed25519 and WebAuthn
  passkey signers, quorum, verifier/policy WASM-hash pinning, multicall, and an
  upgrade timelock.
- DeFi adapters: Blend lending (`lend`), Soroswap swaps (`trade`/`quote`), and
  DeFindex vaults (`vault`), each with venue pinning and fail-closed guardrails.
- Protocol support: SEP-7, SEP-10, SEP-24 and SEP-6, SEP-43, SEP-45, SEP-47,
  SEP-48, and SEP-53.
- Operator approval inbox: `approve list` enumerates pending approvals with
  their wallet-controlled summaries, and `approve serve` runs a loopback-only
  web inbox that lists pending approvals live, notifies the operator, and
  approves (minting the same attestation as `approve --id`) or rejects.
  Rejection records a short-lived marker so the agent's commit is refused
  with `policy.approval_rejected` instead of waiting out the TTL. Session
  bootstrap is a single-use URL token exchanged for an HttpOnly cookie;
  actions require a per-session CSRF header. Approvals now emit audit
  events from both the terminal and inbox surfaces. For a remote agent
  host, the inbox is reached through an SSH port-forward; the approving
  user must be the wallet's OS user.
- Claimable-balance claims by ID (CLI `claim`, MCP `stellar_claim` /
  `stellar_claim_commit` two-phase pair): RPC-backed preview with claimant,
  predicate, clawback, and trustline pre-flight guards. Balance IDs are taken
  as 72-hex, bare 64-hex, or `B...` strkey; listing balances by claimant is a
  Horizon-only query and stays out of scope for the RPC-only wallet.
- x402 v2 Exact Stellar agent payments with an optional SEP-10 counterparty
  identity gate.
- Signed agent toolsets with capability isolation, publisher-signature verification,
  a first-invoke gate, and unconditional per-action approval for toolset-routed
  payments.
- `approve` returns the `approval_attestation` for a payment approval so the agent
  surface can present it to the matching `*_commit` tool, completing the
  simulate-approve-commit flow over MCP.
- An agent knowledge skill under `skills/` (agentskills.io format, with a Claude
  Code marketplace plugin and a downloadable archive) that teaches an AI agent to
  operate the wallet's CLI and MCP server without cloning the repository.
- An agent integration guide (`docs/agents.md`) and capability-isolation example
  toolsets under `examples/toolsets/`.
